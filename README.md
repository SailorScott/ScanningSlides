# ScanningSlides
Using a webcam, USB Relay and hacked slide projector to record slides.

Like many, my father took 100s of slides and to get them digitized is quite expensive. So this is an approach to use a USB controlled relay to activate the slide projector's advance, a 'nice' web camera to capture images and Python to glue it all together.

General Steps
Projector modifiction - my Dad's projector did not have a remote control, so I am going to open it up (you will likely need to clean all the lenses.)

Image capture
Capture and save webcam video in Python using OpenCV - CodeSpeedy

(See reviews for better control scheme)

General Plan
Use old laptop and nice webcam with lens.
Use Python to control relay

Form to capture carousel info and build a  title slide.

Save as images or as video?? Images and then build video.
